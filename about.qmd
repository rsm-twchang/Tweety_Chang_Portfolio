## Background

With a background in business analytics and accounting, I bring hands-on experience analyzing data, identifying process gaps, and supporting data-driven improvements through clear communication and cross-functional collaboration. My work has focused on turning complex, multi-source data into practical insights that support reporting accuracy and informed decision-making.

In recent analytics projects, I have analyzed operational and business data to uncover inconsistencies, trends, and improvement opportunities affecting downstream reporting and analysis. I have supported projects end-to-end by clarifying requirements, validating outputs through testing, documenting findings, and presenting results in a clear, actionable way to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Across roles, I have worked closely with business, analytics, and technical teams to ensure analysis aligned with real user needs and project goals.

I am comfortable working in ambiguous environments, learning new domains quickly, and balancing multiple priorities. I work regularly with Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI, which allows me to move fluidly between data analysis and business context. My background in client-facing and team-based roles has also strengthened my ability to communicate clearly, collaborate effectively, and contribute thoughtfully to shared outcomes.

I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics at UC San Diego and am seeking internship or full-time opportunities where analytical rigor and practical problem-solving can support real-world business decisions.
