This difference is descriptive and does not account for other factors such as firm age or region, which are addressed in the regression analysis.\nFigure 1. Distribution of Patent Counts by Blueprinty Usage\n\nThe histogram shows a right-skewed distribution of patent counts, which is typical for count outcomes. Firms using Blueprinty’s software show a modest rightward shift, suggesting higher patent counts are somewhat more common among customers.\nDescriptively, Blueprinty customers average 4.133 patents over five years versus 3.473 for non-customers. This comparison is correlational: customers are not randomly selected, and differences in firm age or region may explain part of the gap.

Regional effects are small and not statistically significant. The positive age term and negative age_squared term indicate a concave relationship: expected patenting increases with age but the marginal gain declines at higher ages."

At the same time, they highlight the role of firm maturity in shaping innovation outcomes. While regional variation appears limited, the analysis underscores the importance of targeting firms at the right stage of development and aligning product value with their innovation capacity. These insights can guide Blueprinty’s strategic messaging and outreach efforts, particularly when engaging established firms seeking to strengthen their patent portfolios."

Over 50,000 previous donors to a U.S. nonprofit were mailed fundraising letters and randomly assigned to one of two groups:\n\nControl group: received a standard fundraising letter with no special offer\nTreatment group: received a similar letter but was offered a matching donation, meaning their contribution would be matched by another donor\n\nWithin the treatment group, individuals were further randomized into subgroups based on:\n\nMatch ratio: \\(1\\!:\\!1\\), \\(2\\!:\\!1\\), or \\(3\\!:\\!1\\)\nMaximum match amount: \\(25{,}000\\), \\(50{,}000\\), \\(100{,}000\\), or unstated\nSuggested donation amount: equal to 1.25× or 1.5× the donor’s previous contribution\n\nThe randomized design allows for causal analysis of how these variations influence both the decision to donate and the amount given. This experiment provides a powerful example of how field experiments can be used to study economic behavior in natural settings."

The response rate is 2.07% under a 1:1 match, 2.26% under a 2:1 match, and 2.27% under a 3:1 match.\nThe increase in donation rates beyond a 1:1 match is small—0.19 percentage points for a 2:1 match and 0.01 percentage points for a 3:1 match—and not statistically significant, consistent with the formal tests reported earlier. This pattern aligns with the findings of Karlan and List (2007), which show that increasing the match ratio does not materially increase participation once a match is offered.\n\n\n\nMatch Ratio\nDonation Rate\n\n\n\n\n1:1\n0.0207 (2.07%)\n\n\n2:1\n0.0226 (2.26%)\n\n\n3:1\n0.0227 (2.27%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonation Amount\nWe next examine whether the matching donation treatment affects the amount donated among individuals who chose to give, focusing on the intensive margin of charitable giving.\nA two-sample t-test and a linear regression both estimate a small difference in donation amounts between treatment and control donors; however, the effects are not statistically significant at conventional levels (p ≈ 0.06). The estimated magnitudes are modest.\nOverall, these results suggest that while offering a matching donation increases participation, it does not meaningfully affect the amount donated conditional on giving.\n\n\nDistribution of Donation Amounts Among Donors\nFigure 4. Distribution of Donation Amounts by Treatment Status  Donation amounts in both the control and treatment groups are right-skewed, with most contributions concentrated at lower values and a small number of large donations. Mean donation amounts are similar across groups ($45.54 for the control group and $43.87 for the treatment group).\n\nFigure 5. Sampling Distribution of Treatment–Control Differences (Simulated)  The figure shows the distribution of treatment–control differences in donation rates across 10,000 simulated experiments with 500 observations per group. The distribution is approximately normal and centered near 0.004, the difference implied by the assumed donation probabilities. The dashed line indicates the mean simulated difference, and the dotted line marks the null of no treatment effect.\n\n\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nFigure 6. Cumulative estimate of the treatment–control difference in mean donation amounts\n\nFigure 6 plots the cumulative difference in mean donation amounts between the treatment and control groups as observations are added. When the sample size is small, the estimated difference fluctuates substantially. As the number of observations increases, the cumulative estimate stabilizes and converges toward the full-sample difference, illustrated by the horizontal dashed line.\n\n\n\nSampling Variability and Sample Size\nFigure 7. Sampling distributions of treatment–control differences by sample size\n\nFigure 7 shows simulated sampling distributions of treatment–control differences in donation rates for sample sizes of 50, 200, 500, and 1,000. With small samples, the distribution is wide. As sample size increases, the distributions concentrate around their mean, indicating greater precision."

Preparing the Data for Estimation\nThe “hard part” of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer \\(i\\), covariate \\(k\\), and product \\(j\\)) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer \\(i\\) and covariate \\(k\\)). The fact that each task for each respondent has the same number of alternatives (3) helps.

The first row (brand = N, price = 28) has choice = 1, indicating it was selected. Dummy variables for brand and ad presence are created, with Hulu and ad-free as baselines. The data is now formatted for model estimation."

Consumers dislike ads, show brand preferences, and are price-sensitive—patterns expected in digital subscription markets.\nTo simulate or estimate a multi-level MNL model, we must account for individual differences in preferences. Unlike the standard MNL model, which assumes a single set of coefficients shared by all respondents, a hierarchical model allows each respondent to have their own set of parameters.\n\nKey changes: Instead of using one fixed β, assign each respondent a personal βₖ drawn from a population distribution: [ _i (, ) ]\nEstimation:\nEstimate both the respondent-level βᵢs and the population-level parameters (μ, Σ).

Adding isweird improves profit and ROME relative to the baseline. The gain is driven primarily by a reduction in false positives (FP decreases from 6,188 to 5,736), which improves mailing efficiency without materially changing the count of false negatives.\n\n\n\nLR1: baseline logistic regression\nAdding the anomaly indicator (isweird) improved both validation profit and ROME relative to the baseline logistic regression, indicating better campaign efficiency under the profit framework. To interpret what the baseline model is learning, Table X summarizes the key signals from the LR1 coefficient output.\n\nModel fit (LR1)\n\nAUC: 0.755\n\nMcFadden pseudo R²: 0.114\n\nOverall model test: χ²(29) = 2289.8, p &lt; 0.001\n\nSample size: 52,500 (training)\n\nThese statistics indicate the model has meaningful discriminative power for ranking customers, although the pseudo R² suggests substantial unexplained variation remains—typical for response modeling with sparse outcomes.\n\n\nKey drivers (LR1)\nOdds ratios (OR) below are interpreted holding other variables constant:\n\nPrior upgrade behavior (upgraded=1): OR = 2.616 (p &lt; 0.001)\nCustomers with prior upgrade history are much more likely to respond to the upgrade offer.\nCurrently on version 1 (version1=1): OR = 2.113 (p &lt; 0.001)\nBeing on an older version is strongly associated with upgrade likelihood.\nOrdering frequency (numords): OR = 1.259 per additional order (p &lt; 0.001)\nMore prior orders correlate with higher probability of responding.\nRecency (last): OR = 0.957 per additional month since last order (p &lt; 0.001)\nLonger time since last purchase reduces response likelihood, consistent with customer inactivity.\nTax product ownership (owntaxprod=1): OR = 1.356 (p = 0.003)\nOwnership of related products is associated with higher response propensity.\nSpend (dollars): OR ≈ 1.001 per dollar (p &lt; 0.001)\nThe per-dollar effect is small by construction; the practical impact depends on the spend range across customers.\n\n\n\nLimited effects (LR1)\n\nGender (sex) and business flag (bizflag) are not statistically significant in the baseline specification.\nTenure since original purchase (sincepurch) is not significant once recency and purchase behavior are included.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic effects (LR1)\nzip_bins shows large differences relative to the reference bin, with most bins having substantially lower odds than the reference category. This aligns with the earlier EDA result that a localized geographic segment behaves differently and supports isolating that segment explicitly (rather than relying on binning alone).\nFigure 1. LR1 prediction profiles across key predictors\n\nResponse probability is dominated by geography: zip_bins = 1 is a clear outlier, while other bins remain near a low baseline. Behavioral variables show predictable structure—probability increases with numords and is higher for upgraded = 1 and version1 = 1. Recency is strongly negative: response probability declines as last increases. sex, bizflag, and sincepurch are nearly flat over the plotted ranges, suggesting limited incremental value in this specification.\nFigure 2. LR1 permutation importance (AUC decrease)\n\nPermutation importance ranks zip_bins as the strongest driver of model discrimination, followed by upgraded and last. numords and version1 provide moderate contribution; remaining variables add minimal lift. The concentration of signal in the geography feature supports isolating the outlier ZIP behavior explicitly (via isweird) rather than relying on broad ZIP binning alone.\n\n\nLR2: enhanced logistic regression (anomalous ZIP isolation)\nLR2 extends the baseline model by adding isweird, a binary indicator for ZIP codes 00801 and 00804. This feature captures a localized geographic segment with unusually high wave-1 response.\n\nModel fit (LR2)\n\nAUC: 0.768 (vs 0.755 in LR1)\n\nMcFadden pseudo R²: 0.148 (vs 0.114 in LR1)\n\nOverall model test: χ²(30) = 2965.6, p &lt; 0.001\n\nThese changes indicate improved ranking performance after accounting for the anomalous ZIP segment.\n\n\nKey coefficients (LR2)\nisweird is the dominant effect in the model:\n\nisweird = 1: OR = 24.6, p &lt; 0.001\nCustomers in ZIP codes 00801/00804 have substantially higher odds of responding, even after controlling for purchase behavior and product history.\n\nCore purchase-history signals remain stable and directionally consistent: - upgraded = 1: OR = 2.74, p &lt; 0.001 - version1 = 1: OR = 2.18, p &lt; 0.001 - numords: OR = 1.28 per additional order, p &lt; 0.001 - last: OR = 0.956 per additional month since last order, p &lt; 0.001 - owntaxprod = 1: OR = 1.38, p = 0.002\nAfter introducing isweird, most zip_bins coefficients shrink toward neutrality and many become statistically insignificant, indicating that the earlier geographic pattern was primarily driven by the two outlier ZIP codes rather than broad differences across bins.\n\n\nVariable importance\nFigure confirms the same conclusion from a predictive standpoint. Permuting isweird produces the largest AUC degradation, followed by upgraded and last. zip_bins contributes relatively little once the outlier ZIP behavior is modeled explicitly.\n\n\n\n\nFeature refinement: version path construction\nFigure 3. LR2 permutation importance (AUC decrease)\n\nisweird is the dominant driver of LR2 discrimination: permuting it produces the largest AUC drop, far exceeding any other feature. After isolating the 00801/00804 segment, zip_bins contributes little incremental lift, while upgraded and purchase recency (last) remain the strongest broad-based predictors outside the anomaly. This supports modeling the outlier ZIP behavior explicitly with isweird rather than relying on ZIP-bin effects that would blur a concentrated segment signal.\nFigure 4. LR2 prediction profiles across key predictors\n\nAfter adding isweird, the geographic spike shifts from zip_bins to the anomaly indicator. Predicted probability increases sharply when isweird = 1, while the zip_bins profile becomes largely flat, indicating limited incremental segmentation value once the outlier ZIPs are modeled explicitly. Purchase-history signals remain stable: probability increases with numords, and is higher for upgraded = 1 and version1 = 1, while last remains strongly negative.\nOn the validation sample, LR2 (baseline predictors + isweird, with zip_bins retained) achieves profit = 35,444.61 and ROME = 3.88, with projected profit of 1,202,490.81. The confusion matrix is TP = 743, FP = 5,736, TN = 15,661, FN = 360. Relative to LR1, the primary change is a reduction in false positives (fewer low-probability customers mailed), which improves campaign efficiency while keeping overall capture of responders comparable.\n\nConsolidating version1 and upgraded\nFigure 5. LR2 prediction profiles for key predictors\n\nThe prediction profiles show positive shifts for both version1 = 1 and upgraded = 1, but these fields describe overlapping aspects of product history and are not mutually exclusive. To make version behavior interpretable and usable for targeting, the two indicators are recoded into a single categorical feature, version_upgrade, representing mutually exclusive version paths.\nDefinition of version_upgrade (derived from version1 and upgraded)\n\nversion1 = 1, upgraded = 0 → category 0: currently on version 1, no prior upgrade (n = 16,050)\n\nversion1 = 0, upgraded = 1 → category 1: upgraded to version 2 (n = 15,629)\n\nversion1 = 0, upgraded = 0 → category 2: directly purchased version 2 (n = 43,321)\n\nversion1 = 1, upgraded = 1 → not observed in the dataset\n\nThis recode removes ambiguity in interpretation and prevents the model from splitting a single business concept across two correlated indicators.\n\n\nDefining version_upgrade\nversion1 and upgraded describe overlapping aspects of product history and are difficult to interpret separately. They are recoded into a single categorical feature, version_upgrade, representing mutually exclusive version paths:\n\nversion1 = 1, upgraded = 0 → version_upgrade = 0: currently on version 1, no prior upgrade (n = 16,050)\n\nversion1 = 0, upgraded = 1 → version_upgrade = 1: upgraded to version 2 (n = 15,629)\n\nversion1 = 0, upgraded = 0 → version_upgrade = 2: directly purchased version 2 (n = 43,321)\n\nversion1 = 1, upgraded = 1 → not observed in the dataset\n\nThis change is made for interpretability and reporting consistency. Model scoring is unchanged when version1 and upgraded are replaced by version_upgrade.\nFigure 6. Predicted response by version path (version_upgrade)\n\nCustomers who previously upgraded to version 2 have the highest predicted response. Customers still on version 1 score next. Customers who directly purchased version 2 have the lowest predicted response, indicating lower incremental upgrade propensity under the wave-1 offer.\n\n\n\nBenchmark: mail-to-all strategy\nA mail-to-all (“spam”) strategy was evaluated as a benchmark to ensure that targeting adds incremental value versus sending wave-2 to every eligible business.\nOn the validation sample, mailing to all customers yields the following confusion matrix:\n\nTP = 1,103\n\nFP = 21,397\n\nTN = 0\n\nFN = 0\n\nFinancial results for the mail-to-all benchmark are:\n\nProfit (validation): 34,455.00\n\nProjected profit: 1,168,918.80\n\nROME: 1.09\n\nThis benchmark underperforms the targeted logistic regression approaches (e.g., LR2), indicating that selective mailing improves profitability by avoiding low-probability customers. As a result, subsequent work focuses on models that improve ranking quality beyond logistic regression, including neural network classifiers and interaction specifications.\n\n\nNeural network exploration\nA simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier with a single hidden unit was trained on the same inputs used in the logistic model (including isweird and version_upgrade). The objective of this step was to test whether a nonlinear learner identifies materially different structure or improves ranking beyond the logistic specification.\nFigure 7. MLP (1-unit) prediction profiles across key predictors\n\nPredicted response increases sharply for isweird = 1. Outside the anomaly segment, effects are modest and mostly monotone: higher numords raises response, and larger last (less recent) lowers response. Differences across version_upgrade remain visible, while sex, bizflag, sincepurch, and most zip_bins variation are small in the plotted range.\nFigure 8. MLP (1-unit) permutation importance (AUC decrease)\n\nPermutation importance is concentrated in isweird, followed by last and version_upgrade, with numords providing a smaller lift. Most zip_bins indicators contribute little once the anomaly ZIP segment is captured directly.\nFigure 9. MLP permutation importance with a larger hidden layer\n\nAcross both configurations, isweird remains the largest contributor to discrimination, confirming that the anomaly ZIP segment is the strongest signal in the data. Increasing model complexity shifts the relative importance among several features—most noticeably version_upgrade, last, sincepurch, and sex—indicating that nonlinear interactions may be present even when the top driver is unchanged. These shifts are treated as hypothesis-generating: they motivate testing explicit interaction terms in a constrained model (e.g., logistic regression with selected interactions) rather than relying on depth alone.\n\nMLP check: single hidden unit\nUnder the larger MLP configuration, the relative importance of recency (last) increases and several effects appear to vary across segments rather than remaining parallel shifts. Interaction plots highlight three patterns that warrant explicit testing in a constrained model: (1) response differences by zip_bins vary by sex, (2) the uplift from isweird differs across version paths (version_upgrade), and (3) the uplift from isweird varies with ordering behavior (numords).\nAs a screening step, the MLP with a larger hidden layer was evaluated on the validation sample to confirm it remains a viable ranking model. Validation results are TP = 666, FP = 5,398, TN = 15,999, FN = 437 with projected profit = 1,065,600.97 and ROME = 3.67. This underperforms LR2 on projected profit, so the MLP is used here primarily to motivate interaction candidates rather than as the final scoring model.\n\n\n\nLR3: logistic regression with interactions\nDeeper MLP configurations did not deliver a profit lift over the tuned logistic baseline, so interaction effects were tested directly within logistic regression. LR3 extends LR2 by adding three interaction specifications: sex × zip_bins, isweird × version_upgrade, and isweird × numords.\nOn the validation sample, LR3 improves results versus LR2: - Profit (validation): 35,940.90\n- Projected profit: 1,219,324.02\n- ROME: 3.92\n\nWhat changed in LR3\n\nThe anomaly ZIP segment remains the dominant effect: isweird OR = 22.22 (p &lt; 0.001).\nVersion path separation remains strong: version_upgrade[1] OR = 1.27 (p &lt; 0.001) and version_upgrade[2] OR = 0.42 (p &lt; 0.001) relative to the reference category.\nAmong the interaction terms, the clearest incremental effect is isweird × version_upgrade[2] OR = 1.62 (p = 0.002), indicating that within the anomaly ZIP segment, customers who directly purchased version 2 exhibit higher incremental upgrade propensity than the baseline version path.\nisweird × numords is not supported (p = 0.296), suggesting that the anomaly ZIP uplift is largely additive with respect to ordering frequency.\n\nSeveral sex × zip_bins coefficients are statistically significant, implying that geographic differences are not uniform across gender categories in some bins. Because this interaction family introduces many parameters, its value is assessed primarily by validation profit rather than by individual coefficient significance.\n\n\nModel specification and validation performance\nMLP1 is selected as the final scoring model because it delivers the highest projected profit on the validation sample among the evaluated approaches. Hyperparameters were chosen through cross-validated search over network depth, regularization, and learning rate. Recall was used during tuning to avoid missing responders, and the final selection criterion was validation profit.\nThe selected configuration uses a three-layer architecture (3, 3, 3) with L2 regularization alpha = 0.0095 (solver: Adam). Validation performance:\n\nConfusion matrix: TP = 768, FP = 6,292, TN = 15,105, FN = 335\n\nProfit (validation): 36,125.40\n\nProjected profit: 1,225,587.45\n\nROME: 3.63\n\n\n\nInterpretation: permutation importance (MLP1)\nFigure 10. MLP1 permutation importance (AUC decrease)\n\nThe importance ranking is concentrated in a small set of features. isweird produces the largest AUC drop when permuted, indicating that the anomaly ZIP segment is the strongest discriminator."

These patterns were consistent across models and remained the primary drivers of response separation.\nThe selected modeling approach provides a practical scoring framework that can be reused for future waves. After wave-2, results should be reviewed to confirm that the anomaly ZIP segment and version-path effects remain stable, and the targeting cutoff should be recalibrated using observed wave-2 economics and response rates."

    "text": "K-Means Clustering\n\nSelecting the Number of Clusters\nFigure 1. Custom K-Means — Iteration 1 \nWith randomly initialized centroids, clusters are still loosely defined and several regions overlap, especially in the middle of the plot. The centroid markers show starting positions that do not yet match the densest parts of the data.\nFigure 2. Custom K-Means — Iteration 2 \nAfter one update, centroids shift sharply toward high-density areas and the cluster boundaries become more coherent. Most of the separation emerges here, with a clearer split between the high–flipper-length group and the two lower bands.\nFigure 3. Custom K-Means — Final clustering (Iteration 10)\n\nIteration 10 represents the converged solution. Centroid movement is negligible relative to earlier iterations, and cluster assignments are stable. The final clustering forms three distinct groups, primarily separated by flipper length with bill length refining boundaries within clusters.\n\n\nComparison with scikit-learn implementation\nTo validate the custom K-Means implementation, the final centroids are compared with those obtained from scikit-learn. Each centroid is shown as:\n(Bill Length, Flipper Length)\n\n\n\nCluster\nCustom Implementation\nscikit-learn\n\n\n\n\n1\n(38.45, 187.05)\n(39.56, 188.14)\n\n\n2\n(47.63, 216.92)\n(48.14, 219.29)\n\n\n3\n(45.95, 196.73)\n(46.50, 201.77)\n\n\n\nThe centroid locations are close across implementations. Small differences are expected due to initialization and convergence tolerance, but both methods identify the same overall cluster structure.\n\nWithin-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)\nSelecting the Number of Clusters (WCSS) {fig4_wcss}\nWCSS decreases as the number of clusters increases, which is expected because additional clusters reduce within-group variance. The largest drop occurs between k = 2 and k = 3, after which the curve begins to flatten. This “elbow” suggests that three clusters capture most of the structure in the data without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n\nSilhouette Score\nCluster Quality (Silhouette Score) {fig5_silhouette}\nThe silhouette score is highest at k = 2, but remains reasonably strong at k = 3. Because the WCSS elbow occurs at three clusters and the dataset contains three biological species, k = 3 provides a balanced and interpretable solution.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Cluster Quantity\nTo select the number of clusters, WCSS and silhouette scores were computed for k = 2 to 7.\n\n\n\nK\nWCSS\nSilhouette Score\n\n\n\n\n2\n20949.79\n0.612\n\n\n3\n14269.56\n0.456\n\n\n4\n9587.14\n0.445\n\n\n5\n7597.61\n0.410\n\n\n6\n6326.31\n0.414\n\n\n7\n6030.08\n0.370\n\n\n\nAlthough the silhouette score is highest at k = 2, this solution collapses two biologically distinct groups into a single cluster. The WCSS curve shows a clear elbow at k = 3, indicating substantial variance reduction when moving from 2 to 3 clusters.\nBecause three clusters preserve meaningful morphological distinctions while still maintaining reasonable separation, k = 3 provides a more interpretable segmentation.\n\n\nFinal Clustering Result (k = 3)\n{fig6_kmeans_k3}\nWith k = 3, the algorithm separates the data into three distinct groups. The upper cluster captures penguins with the longest flippers and bills, the lower-left cluster represents shorter measurements, and the middle cluster occupies the intermediate range. Centroids (black markers) lie near the center of each group, indicating stable cluster formation."

    "text": "Interpretation\nThe three clusters differ primarily along flipper length. One group shows substantially shorter flippers and bills, another shows the longest measurements, and the third occupies the intermediate range.\nCentroid values indicate that flipper length drives most of the separation, with differences exceeding 20–30 mm between groups. Cluster sizes are reasonably balanced, suggesting the segmentation is not dominated by outliers."
